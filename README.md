# 📝 To-Do App (React Hooks)

A simple and elegant **To-Do List Application** built with **React Hooks** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
This app allows users to add, edit, delete, and toggle tasks — all stored locally in the browser using `localStorage`.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks  
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks  
- ❌ Delete tasks  
- ☑️ Mark tasks as completed / pending  
- 💾 Auto-save using `localStorage`  
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI built with Tailwind CSS
